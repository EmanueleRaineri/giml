1.at a given lambda, intervals should be non overlapping and have
coordinates growing along the genome
2.sum of lengths of all the intervals should not change when changing lambda and should be 
the same as the length of the input file
3.it should be possible to create artificial datasets such that they collapse to
a single interval or
4.they are impossible to collapse and remain separated points
5.sum of cpgs at each lambda should be tha same as number of lines
in input file
