\begin{abstract}
Due to the growing numbers of tracks of numerical values attached to the 
human genome, especially in the field of epigenetics measurements 
(chromatin modification,
Hi-C, whole genome bisulfite sequencing, and more), 
it is useful to implement software 
which can quickly summarize the data and extract patterns to help 
automating at least  part of the biological analysis. 
In this paper, I show one efficient way of computing 
segmentations of methylation values determined by 
whole genome bisulfite sequencing
(hence inferred from the number of converted and non converted reads 
at each position).  
A segmentation joins adjacent position
which have similar properties, while the boundary between segments 
indicates more or less abrupt changes
in the signal which might relate to biological mechanisms. 
For example
a drop in methylation in a promoter area is is some cases associated with 
transcriptional activity of the corresponding gene; 
segments with intermediate values might be related to imprinted regions; 
and so on and so forth.
One salient aspects which must be considered when it comes to 
analyzing methylation dataset is that this epigenetic mark seems 
to have effect at various genomic scales 
(ranging from hundred of bases to megabases), hence a multi scale method 
is called for. 
Here I introduce a fast probabilistic model which, coupled with a known greedy 
algorithm for copy number detection 
(of which I rewrote the implementation from scratch) 
calculates automatic segmentations at different scales.
I also present some concrete examples of its utility. 
In particular I will show how this 
kind of statistical modeling is very useful for 
visualization, comparison across samples,
comparison with other kind of data which are naturally expressed as a set of 
segments (e.g. chromatin modifications),  and demarcation of unusual regions in 
order to direct further analysis (i.e. regions with stark variations in the signal).

\section{Introduction}

Whole genome Bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) allows measurements of methylation 
status with single base resolution across an entire genome. This tecnique proves 
that the genome contains a few loci corresponding to sudden changes in methylation 
and many more regions where this epigenetic mark has a strong local
correlation, in the sense the the methylation status at one position predicts 
very well the levels nearby. 
This local correlation has been observed many times ( for example
in the Bsmooth paper \cite{bsmooth}) and is confirmed in 
figure~\ref{corr} which I computed 
first selecting at random $10^6$ pairs of  methylated loci; then binning
them according to the distance between the members of the pair (I considered 20 
bins corresponding to distance between $0$ and $100$bp,$100$ and $200$bp, 
etc\dots);
finally computing for each bin the correlation in methylation values 
across the pairs contained in it.

binning the pairs in $20$ different bins  according to the distance between the members
of the pair (from $0-100$ to $1900-2000$); and computing the correlation in each bin,
using the pairs contained in it.}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

Another interesting aspect of methylation is that it possesses some sort of scale 
invariance: variations can be observed both at the level of a single promoter
region (hundred of bases, see for example XXX) and when looking at stretches
of millions of bases (cite XXX).
This entails some problems when analyzing this kind of data: a rough
running average with a window of many megabases might destroy interesting
local detail, but at the same time large scale (slow) changes are also
significant and must be looked at.
I present  a software (\gimli) which computes a multiscale segmentation 
of DNA methylation 
data acquired through WGBS and helps making sense of the data and compare 
it across samples.

A segmentation is a statistical model of a dataset.
In general, when building a statistical model one tries to find a reasonable 
trade off between two 
features of it: its goodness of fit and its complexity.
In our case these two aspects have a very simple interpretation : the goodness 
of fit increases with the number of segments $N_S$ used to describe the 
methylation data whereas the complexity of the model decreases with $N_S$.  
At one extreme, representing the complete dataset with one big segment would 
give a very simple model with the worst possible fit and 
at the other using many segments of length $1$ would give us a perfectly 
fitting but very complex summary of the data.
The complexity of the model is linked to the typical scale of the segments used
in the sense that if the typical block is very long one needs few of them to 
cover the genomic region under consideration.

\section{The algorithm}

The  input to \gimli is a set of $N$ methylated positions 
(CpGs or not CpGs) indexed by $j=1,\dots,N$ 
(for human chromosome $1$ and at a 
decent coverage one has $N \approx 2E6$).

The output is a set of blocks (note : in what follows, I will call block or ,
equivalently, segment
both a single CpG or a set of contiguous CpGs)  covering the genome 
such that each block contains CpGs which are similarly
methylated. The strength with which
one imposes the similarity constraint
is controlled by a coarseness parameter $\lambda$.

Internally \gimli mantains a list of the current  
segments (indexed by $i=1,\dots,N_S$), 
which at the beginning 
coincides with the separate methylated positions 
( i.e.  $N_S=N$ and each block has length $1$). 

The way the program works is by 
scanning repeatedly this list and evaluate whether any pair 
of adjacent blocks can be conveniently merged into one.  
This is decided by checking whether the loss in 
likelihood consequent to the merging is compensated 
(or more than compensated)
by the reduction in complexity achieved by it.

In turn the log likelihood of a block is defined by the
two following formul\ae:

If the
segment coincides with a single locus, 
the log likelihood  is evaluated as 

\[\lik_i=\log {\overline{n}_i+n \choose \overline{n}_i} +
	{\overline{n}_i}\hat{\theta}_i+
	n_i(1-\hat{\theta}_i)
\]\label{loglik}

where

$n_i$ and $\overline{n}_i$ are the converted and unconverted reads respectively 
and

\[\hat{\theta}_i=\frac{\overline{n}_i}{\overline{n}_i+n_i}\]

is the maximum likelihood estimation for the parameter of the binomial process 
which generates $\overline{n}_i$.

If (more in general) a block contains  more than a single CpG  
( think for concreteness of a segment which includes all the positions from 
$j_1$ to $j_2$ ) $\lik$ is 
computed as in equation (\ref{loglik}) except that $\hat{\theta}$ is now
defined as :

\[
\hat{\theta}=\frac{\overline{n}}{n + \overline{n}}
\]

where

\[
\overline{n}=\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} \overline{n}_j
\]

and

\[
n=\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} n_j
\]

The total likelihood of the segmentation is given by 
$\mathcal{L}=\sum_i\mathcal{L}_i$.

The loss in 
total likelihood that we get if we merge a pair $(i,i+1)$ of 
adjacent segments in one single block is:

\[\Delta_{(i,i+1)} \lik=\lik-\mathcal{L}_i-\mathcal{L}_{i+1}+\mathcal{L}_{i,i+1}\]

notice that $\mathcal{L} \leq \mathcal{L}_1+\mathcal{L}_2$ hence merging always 
results in a loss in total 
likelihood. This loss is counterbalanced, though, by the fact the the number 
of segments decreases by $1$. To take into account this decrease in 
complexity we consider an adjusted likelihood change:

$\tilde{\Delta_{(i,i+1)} \lik} = \Delta_{(i,i+1)} \lik+\lambda$.

The above definitions are the ingredients necessary to the the greedy part of 
the procedure, which is conceptually the same as the one
described in the context of copy number variation detection in \cite{vega} 
( which, in turn, us an adaptation 
of a 2 dimensional image analysis algorithm due to Mumford and Shah, 
\cite{mumfordshah}) barring that my method of measuring goodness of fit, described
above, differs from theirs (the solution adopted for copy number variation detection
does not work well with methylation data).

Once it has computed 
$\tilde{\Delta_{(i,i+1)} \lik}$ for all $i$, tha algorithm selects the maximum 
one : if this is positive, it conjoins the corresponding segments into one.

The software repeats the scanning and merging until it is not possible to 
merge any more pair of adjacent segments; in this case depending on what the 
user wants it can either increment $\lambda$ and try again, 
or give up, print the segmentation and exit.

\subsection{sparsity of CpGs}

Methylated sites are irregularly spaced along the genome and the variability 
introduced by the sequencing process usually increases the distance 
between adjacent sites.
To avoid building segments which span long regions where no CpGs exist, one 
can multiply $\lambda$ by a penalty term of the
form $\exp(-\frac{D_{i,i+1}}{D_0})$ where $D_{i,i+1}$ is the distance 
between the the rigth end of segment $i$ and the left end of segment $i+1$ and 
$D_0$ is a constant which (looking at figure \ref{corr}) can be reasonably 
set to $1000$. 

Hence the final expression for the adjusted likelihood change is :

$\Delta \lik = \Delta \lik+\lambda \exp(-\frac{D_{i,i+1}}{D_0}) $.

I can now refine quantitatively the assertion that the complexity of the model
is linked to the typical lengths of the segments : as figure \ref{boxplot1} 
shows the median length of the blocks increases with $\lambda$. This is 
accompanied by a decrease in likelihood of the segments (\ref{boxplot2})

\begin{figure}\label{boxplot1}
\includegraphics[width=7cm,angle=270]{boxplot1.eps}
\caption{Median length of blocks is higher at higher $\lambda$s.}
\end{figure}

\caption{Likelihood of blocks diminishes with $\lambda$.}

\section{examples}

While one can verify that the numbers computed by \gimli are in 
accordance with the description
of the algorithm given in this paper, the purpose of gimli is to help 
detect automatically interesting
biological patterns in methylation data, and this can't be tested in any 
precise sense. To show that \gimli is a useful tool
though, I will give 4 examples of analyses which can be produced very quickly
using it. 

\subsection{visualization}

In figure \ref{ex1} I plotted the methylation in blocks (with $\lambda=1000$) 
across the whole of chromosome $1$ for $4$ Blueprint samples
(G199,G200,G201,G202). Although the plot represents around $2$ millions of 
CpGs per each sample, the reduction in complexity achieved by \gimli makes it 
possible to observe some relevant signal by eye (in this case there is 
an apparent loss of methylation across the $4$ samples, which are different 
stages in the hematopoietic process).

\begin{figure}\label{ex1}
\includegraphics[width=7cm,angle=270]{G199.G200.G201.G202.chr1.gimli.eps}
\caption{output of \gimli, for $\lambda=1000$ for four Blueprint samples. The loss of
methylation is clearly visible.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{comparison across samples (DMRs)}

\gimli makes it easy to find regions which have different 
methylations across samples. One needs to find segments 
from the first and the second batch which intersect spatially
but correspond to non overlapping intervals of methylation 
(the maximum value of one 
segment is less than the minimum of the other).

Users can fine tune this procedure according to what exactly they 
are looking for, taking into account that a standard deviation of $0.2$
on the methylation measurements done with WGBS is not unusual, hence
DMRs must be substantially separated to avoid confusion with sampling error.

Also notice that I am not giving any algorithm to compute $p$-values
or anything of the sort; first of all the credibility of each segment
is measured by its log likelihood; secondly users can choose statistical
tests suited to the specific signal (and the specific scale)
they are considering.

\begin{figure}\label{ex1}
\includegraphics[width=7cm,angle=270]{G199.G202.20.200.dmr.eps}
\caption{Differentially methylated regions : I considered segments corresponding to
non overlapping intervals of methylation values (ie the max value of one 
segment is less than the minimum of the other).}
\end{figure}

\subsection{comparison with other kind of data}

Many dataset in genomics are naturally expressed as segments. The
fact that \gimli also generates annotated blocks allows one to
integrate methylation data with other kind of information easily
using such packages as, for instance, bedtools (XXX).

As an example, I consider the set of $5227$ transcription start sites
(TSSes) on human chromosome $1$. I infer the TSSes from a list of 
regions used for gene expression quantification by the Blueprint 
consortium. For each of them, I also consider the RPKM of the corresponding
gene in the sample $C004GD$. I then compute with \gimli the segmentation
of the methylation measurements for chromosome $1$ of $C004GD$.

My intent is to show that the segments overlapping the TSSs
say something about the transcriptional activity of the nearby gene.
Accordingly,
I use bedtools to intersect the list of blocks produced by \gimli
with the list of transcription start sites; since more than one \gimli
block can overlap a given TSS (blocks with different $\lambda$s can 
cover the same region) I choose the largest segment covering the TSS
with the constraint thet the maximum and minimum value of methylation
in the block must not differ by more than $0.3$.

I then compare the distribution of RPKMs for genes corresponding
to TSS covered by segments with $\hat{\theta}<0.5$ with the same distribution
for genes adjacent to TSS covered by blocks with $\hat{\theta} \geq 0.5$

\begin{figure}\label{ex3}
\includegraphics[width=7cm,angle=270]{boxplot_example_3.eps}
\caption{Segments with different $\hat{\theta}$ overlapping the TSS correspond
to different distribution of the RPKMs of the corresponding genes.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Demarcation of unusual regions} 

Next I used \gimli to look for regions where the 
methylation
ratio goes from high to low and to high again.

In chromosome $1$ of G199, $972$ such intervals intersect one (or more) 
TSSes. I haven't annotated the remaining ones, but in my view they constitute
an interesting pattern to look at.

\section{implementation}

\gimli is written in \texttt{C}, and the source
dode is available from the github page of the author. Together
with \gimli I also distribute \texttt{libgimli.R},
a set of R functions which can be used to produce plots and statistical
analyses based on \gimli's output.
