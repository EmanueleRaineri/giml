Due to the growing numbers of tracks of numerical values attached to the 
human genome,
especially in the field of epigenetics measurements 
(chromatin modification,
Hi-C, whole genome bisulfite sequencing, and more), 
it is useful to implement software 
which summarize the data and extract patterns to help automatizing at least 
part of the biological analysis. 

In this respect, I am looking for ways to compute 
segmentations of methylation values measured with 
whole genome bisulfite sequencing
(hence inferred from the number of converted and non converted reads at each 
position).  
A segmentation joins adjacent position
which have similar properties, while boundary between segments point to 
more or less abrupt changes
in the signal which might relate to biological mechanisms. For example
a drop in methylation in the promoter area is is some cases associated with 
transcriptional activity of the corresponding gene; 
segments with intermediate values might be associated to imprinted regions; 
and so on and so forth.

There are two salient aspects that must be considered when it comes to 
segmenting methylation values : 
first, this epigenetic mark seems to have effect at various genomic scales 
(ranging from hundred of bases to megabases), hence a multiscale method 
is called for. 
Second, measurements through whole genome bisulfite sequencing are affected by 
sampling error which becomes more important at low coverage.

I present a fast probabilistic model which, coupled with a known greedy 
algorithm for copy number detection 
(of which I rewrote the implementation from scratch) 
provides a method (aware of the sampling error) for producing automatic 
segmentations at different scales.

I am using this method in my day-to-day work analyzing data for the Blueprint 
EU project and hence can present 
some practical examples of its utility. In particular I will show how this 
kind of statistical modeling is very useful for 

*visualization purposes
*comparison across samples
*comparison with other kind of data which are naturally expressed as set of 
segments (eg chromatin modifications)
*definition of interesting regions in order to prioritize further analysis 
(ie regions with abrupt, stark variations in the signal)
