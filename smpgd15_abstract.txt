Due to the growing numbers of tracks of numerical values attached to the 
human genome,
especially in the field of epigenetics measurements 
(chromatin modification,
Hi-C, whole genome bisulfite sequencing, and more), 
it is useful to implement software 
which can quickly summarize the data and extract patterns to help automating 
at least  part of the biological analysis. 

In this respect, I am looking at ways to compute 
segmentations of methylation values determined by 
whole genome bisulfite sequencing
(hence inferred from the number of converted and non converted reads at each 
position).  

A segmentation joins adjacent position
which have similar properties, while the boundary between segments indicates 
more or less abrupt changes
in the signal which might relate to biological mechanisms. For example
a drop in methylation in a promoter area is is some cases associated with 
transcriptional activity of the corresponding gene; 
segments with intermediate values might be related to imprinted regions; 
and so on and so forth.

One salient aspects which must be considered when it comes to 
analyzing methylation dataset is that this epigenetic mark seems 
to have effect at various genomic scales 
(ranging from hundred of bases to megabases), hence a multi scale method 
is called for. 

Here I introduce a fast probabilistic model which, coupled with a known greedy 
algorithm for copy number detection 
(of which I rewrote the implementation from scratch) 
calculates automatic 
segmentations at different scales.

I am using this method in my day-to-day work analyzing data for the Blueprint 
EU project and hence can present 
some concrete examples of its usefulness. In particular I will show how this 
kind of statistical modeling is very useful for 

*visualization 
*comparison across samples
*comparison with other kind of data which are naturally expressed as a set of 
segments (e.g. chromatin modifications)
*demarcation of unusual regions in order to direct further analysis 
(i.e. regions with stark variations in the signal)
