#methyldiff: a short summary

a short intro to the innards of methyldiff

-Methylation level: $\theta$

-You never know it with infinite precision (due to finite coverage)

-Nonconverted reads : $\overline{n}$. Converted reads: $n$.

---

If you knew $\theta$, you could compute the probability
of observing $\overline{n}$ non converted reads.

#Gimli: greedy methylation levels

A numerical example

```{r echo=F}
df=data.frame(rep("chr1",5),1:5,c(10,20,25,20,0),c(10,0,5,20,20))
names(df)<-c("chrom","pos","nc","c")
```

```{r}
df
```

-------------

```{r echo=F}
df<-within(df,theta<-nc/(nc+c))
```

```{r}
df
```
